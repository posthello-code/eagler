Hello, repo owner here.

I'm using simple trunk development at the moment

* Make a branch off of main
* You should be running the automatic dart formatter before committing
* Push your changes to github
* Tests need to pass in the pipeline (you can run them locally with `flutter test test/services/* test/widgets/*` 
* I will approve the PR if the tests pass
* I may request changes if there's something I don't like, but I'm not incredibly idiomatic about this project at the moment, I will likely approve any meaningful changes that are reasonable improvements.
