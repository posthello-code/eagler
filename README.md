# eagler

A flutter app for getting the result from an API.

It supports Bearer tokens, and the user can configure a custom path to parse values out of JSON responses.

There is a toggle to send the requests on a recurring 1 minute interval. 

If the extracted value is a number, you can alert on min, max or equal to conditions.

If the extracted value is a string, you can alert if it contains a specified value.
