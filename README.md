# eagler

A flutter app for getting the result from an API.

It supports Bearer tokens, and the user can configure a custom path to parse values out of JSON responses.

In the future I'll add scheduling, response validation, and push alerts for value thresholds or string matching.

Check out the web version [here](posthello-code.github.io/eagler/)
